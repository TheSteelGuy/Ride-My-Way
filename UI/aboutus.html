               <p align="left">
                  Carpooling is the sharing of 
                  car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for 
                  others to have to drive to a location themselves.
                  By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs such as: fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving.
                </p> 
                <p align="left">
                    Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys 
                    reduces air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for
                    parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during periods of
                    high pollution or high fuel prices.
